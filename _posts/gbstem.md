### What is the Greater Boston STEM Program?
Founded in 2020, the Greater Boston STEM Program (gbSTEM) is a Cambridge-based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that provides free STEM enrichment classes and programs to underserved K-8 students around Greater Boston. Since our inception in 2020, we have reached 2000+ students in 103 schools and 53 towns. Over 75% of our students are students of color. Our leadership and instructor team of over 400 volunteers is entirely comprised of college and high school students passionate about STEM outreach and education.

  
Nevertheless, one can always be doing more! One of our primary objectives in the near future is to enroll students from a wider range of towns, especially the suburbs closer to Boston. We recognize that education is a vital pathway to opportunity, and we aim to eliminate every student's barriers to exploring their interests in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

  
In addition, this fall we are excited to launch gbSTEM's FIRST Lego League Robotics program with free admission, thus eliminating any administrative or financial barriers that might otherwise bar students from participating. Competinng in lego robotics will provide students with hands-on experience in robotics and programming. This initiative will not only inspire creativity and critical thinking but also empower students to work collaboratively and develop essential problem-solving skills. 

### Program Expansion
To enhance our programs and broaden our impact, we are actively pursuing program partnerships with institutions including Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UMass Lowell). Many of these universities have STEM outreach programs that are eager to collaborate with our programs, potentially giving their students a new community service opportunity and helping gbSTEM's students learn more about these universities, various STEM fields, and career pathways.

### The Cost of Administration
Running a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization is not easy! Some of the regular duties of a president include: 

- Getting new students aware of our program every semester
- Visiting outreach events during the summer
- Soliciting partnerships with universities
- Recruiting new instructors
- Managing media and communications
- Maintaining the webtechnology that allows gbSTEM classes to run
- Organizing and keeping responsible gbSTEM's leadership and curriculum development teams.
- Designing merchandise
- Ensuring classes are running smoothly
- Composing biweekly newsletters
- Engaging donors
